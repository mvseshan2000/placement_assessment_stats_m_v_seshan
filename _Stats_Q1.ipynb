    "The correlation coefficient measures the degree of relationship between two variables. It is obtained by dividing the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. The coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating the weakest correlation, 1 representing a strong positive correlation, and -1 representing a strong negative correlation.\n",
